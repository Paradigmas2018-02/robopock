## Running the Game
To run the game you need to clone [this repository](https://github.com/Paradigmas2018-02/pokerhs) for our API.  
```bash
  runghc Api.hs
```
  
Now you can run the game with:
```bash
  swipl menu.pl
```

The Prolog console will be running and now you can start the game:
```Prolog
  main.
```

The game will ask for your choices between 1-7 and the first one should always be a new game.  
Remember to always write a number and a dot to end the sentence. E.G. "1."
